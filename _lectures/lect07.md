## Data and number representation 

* Positional encoding: binary, hex, decimal 
* Internal vs. external representation
* Conversion between different representations
* Key ideas: bits can represent ANYTHING. With n bits we can represent at most 2^N things
* Apply above rule to represent characters (ASCII), unicode, colors ....
* What is signed vs unsigned integer representation
* Signed representation used by modern computers: two's complement
* The data type of a variable determines its representation in memory AND the number of bits used to store each variable
* Model of memory
