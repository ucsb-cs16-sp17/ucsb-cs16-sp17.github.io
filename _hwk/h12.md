Re-read Chapter 13, section 13.1 (If you do not have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve").

For all the following questions, use the definitions of the struct Node and struct LinkedList from lab 06.
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>
1.(10 pts) Implement a function that returns the number of even elements in a linked list. Test your code before writing it out. Illegible code will receive 0 credit.
<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int countEven(Linklist* list){
	
















}
```

</div>
2.(2 pts) In the implementation of a linked list, why does struct Node contain a pointer member variable of type Node *?
<div style="margin-bottom:6em"></div>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>
3.(10 pts) You are given the following memory map, where the numbers on the left column are memory locations and the numbers on the right are 4 byte values stored at each location. Suppose that a linked-list is stored in the given memory segment. In the memory map there exists a pointer (named 'list') to a LinkedList object. You are given the location of list to be 0x8008. Draw the pointer diagram for the linked list showing all the nodes in the linked-list, the data stored in each node and all pointers, starting with the variable 'list'. The LinkedList and Node types are the same as those defined in lab06

4.(10 pts) Implement a function that takes a linked list as an input and returns a dynamic array containing the data elements of the linked list. Test your code before writing it out. Illegible code will receive 0 credit.
<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int* linkedListToArray(Linklist* list);
```
