Read Chapter 8 and the lecture notes. If you do not have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve".

<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL! FOR BEST RESULTS, SAVE THIS PAGE AS A PDF, THEN PRINT THE PDF.</b>

1.(2 pts) How are ordinary arrays of characters and c-strings similar and how are they dissimilar?
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

2.(4 pts) What are two (2) things that are wrong with this use of a c-string (ignore why someone would write this code, focus on logic/syntax errors)?

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
char s1[5] = "Mark", s2[5] = "Jill";
for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++)
	s1[i] = s2[i];
if (s1 != s2) s1 = "Art";
```
</div>


3.(4 pts) What is the output of the following code?

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
char s1[4] = "abc", s2[4] = "ABC";
if (strcmp(s1, s2)) cout << "Hi!";
else cout << "Hey!";
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>
4.(8 pts) The following code takes in a string input from the user and performs an integer multiplication, as seen in the example run here. Note that the input string will contain the asterix character (i.e. *):

```
Enter 2 integer numbers to be multiplied, like this: num1*num2: 15*3
The answer is: 45
```

Complete the missing code below that performs this task (it can be done in 2 lines, but you can use more if you like).

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
string s; int k(0);
cout << "Enter 2 integer numbers to be multiplied, like this: num1*num2: "; 
cin >> s; 




cout << "The answer is: " << k << endl;
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:12em"></div>

5.(10 pts) Show the output produced when the following code (entire program not shown) is executed. You are encouraged to also try to compile this in a program to verify your results.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
    string name = "Jeffery Tambor";

    cout << "NAME = " + name << endl;
    cout << name.length() << endl;

    name.erase(8, 6);
    cout << name << endl;
    name.append("Dean WD Morgan");
    cout << name << endl;

    name.insert(22, "@TWD");
    cout << name << endl;
    name.replace(23, 3, "The WD");
    cout << name << endl;

    cout << name.find("WD") << endl;
    cout << name.rfind("WD") << endl;
    cout << name.rfind("fery") << endl;

    for (int i = name.length(); i > 20; i--)
        cout << name[i-1];
    cout << endl;
```
</div>
