## Instructions for the exam (please note that instructions for miderm 2 are different from midterm 1)

* You may bring one 8.5" x 11" piece of paper with notes on both sides. This paper will be collected along with your exam, so make your own copy if you would like to keep it.
* You may add your notes to this [COLLABORATIVE DOCUMENT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ctpQAlAiTz5L8m8m9ibGlQG9Jcir4xmIUFiknvRR0wk/edit?usp=sharing). 
* No calculators or phones are allowed in the exam  
* There are no makeups for this exam 
* You must write your name on every single sheet of paper including your notes
* We will provide you with scratch paper
* We will provide you the table of operator precedence
* The format of the exam will be similar to midterm 1
* Seating will be assigned - please check on Piazza

* Consolidated [exam notes]( 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1reYOFGbQjos9PJIIVppPSorxpzcMSS9YfdP9MNWnesI/edit?usp=sharing
 )

## Reference material
You are expected to know the material from the following lectures, labs and homeworks. Please be sure to review the code from lecture which can be found in the lecture notes (different from lecture slides)


## Code written in lecture
[https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-sp17/lectures](https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-sp17/lectures)
* Lecture 1 to lecture 12 
The main emphasis will be on file io and topics covered after midterm 1, with the exception of tdd. In other words, you will be primarily tested on pointers, references, arrays, structs, pointers to basic or struct type. A full list is provided later in this document. You will also not be tested on github.
* Homeworks 1 to 10
* Labs 0 to 5 

* Pracice problem: Please go through the problems in our [Concept Inventory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1z9k2M7uTvJaE9rR0F0OVV5ZWs?usp=sharing) for additional preparation. We recommend that you try these problems after you have studied/contributed to the collaborative notes (see above) and gone through the labs, homeworks and lectures.


## Midterm Study Guide

* Memory 
    * Basic model of memory (addressable bytes) 
    * Representing multi-byte data like ints, address of multi-byte variables
    * Program layout in memory during runtime 
    * Interaction of programs with memory (run-time stack vs. heap) (general theme in all the following topics, almost every lecture talks about this)

* Data representation:
    * Conversions between difference bases using positional encoding (hex decimal binary)
    * Finding the range of values with fixed numbers of bits for unsigned representation
    
* Arrays: [hw 08](/hwk/h08/),  [lab 04](/lab/lab04/), [lec 08](/lectures/lect08/), [lec 09](/lectures/lect09/), [lec11](/lectures/lect11/)
    * declaration [lec 08](/lectures/lect08/)
    * initialization [lec 08](/lectures/lect08/)
    * representation in memory [lec 08](/lectures/lect08/)
    * accessng elements via index-based and range-based for loops [lec 08](/lectures/lect08/) 
    * passing arrays to functions [lec 09](/lectures/lect09/), [lec11](/lectures/lect11/)
    * **tracing/writing code involving arrays and showing program dynamics via pointer diagrams** 

* Pointers: [hw 10](/hwk/h10/),  [lab 05](/lab/lab05/), [lec 09](/lectures/lect09/)
    * purpose
    * declaration, size of a pointer
    * initialization to null value, initialization using '&' operator
    * pointer diagrams showing relationship between pointer and pointee
    * derefencing pointers using the '*' operator
    * assignment involving pointers: making two pointers point to the same object
    * changing where a pointer points to
    * **tracing/writing code involving pointers and showing program dynamics via pointer diagrams** 

* References: [hw 08](/hwk/h08/), [lab 05](/lab/lab05/), [lec 10](/lectures/lect10/)
    * Definition

* Structs: [hw 10](/hwk/h10/), [lab 05](/lab/lab05/), [lec 10](/lectures/lect10/), [lec 13](/lectures/lect13/), also review [code covered in lec 11](https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-wi17/lecture-02-16)
    * Defining a struct as a data type [lec 10](/lectures/lect10/)
    * Declaring objects of struct on the stack [lec 10](/lectures/lect10/)
    * Accessing memory variables using the dot (.) operator [lec 10](/lectures/lect10/)

## Past exams
You may also refer to all the past exams. Please note that some questions on these exams may refer to labs that you have not completed so far. You will only be asked questions related to the labs you have completed. The past exams should however provide some information on the expected difficulty and approximate format of the exam. Please note that there may be differences in content as well.
